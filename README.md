#Nick's Arcade Game Clone

Welcome to my arcade game! In this document I will describe the game mechanics I have implemented so far. I intend to add more to the game over time, including more **animations**, **new items** to pick up (_speed booster_, for example), and some prompts for when you score a point or die.

##How to Run

For now, download the project and open up the index.html file in your broswer and it will start automatically.
I put it up on Github pages soon, and it will be much easier to play.

##How To Play

The goal of the game is the get the highest score possible before you run out of lives. Acquire points by moving onto the water squares at the top.

You are the little grey haired girl on the bottom of the screen. Use the directional arrows on your keyboard to move her around.

If you are hit by a **bug** or a **rock**, you will lose a **Life**. If you have no more **lives** when you get hit, your score will reset to 0 and the game is started.

pick up a **Heart**, and it will give you +1 life.

Have fun!

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
